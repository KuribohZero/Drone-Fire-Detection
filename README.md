## Early Fire and Smoke Detection for Forest Fires for UAV

The code in this project is used for my final year project on the early detection of forest fires using UAV.
To achieve this we are using a raspberry pi 5 with hailo AI hat combined with a raspberry pi camera and cvbs thermal camera.
The fire and smoke detection models will be trained using YOLO 11n to allow for real-time detection.
